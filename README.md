# SINR_achived
# similar for both PDF and CDF
# assuming Normal distribution for both CDF and PDF generation

Install libraries numpy, matplotlib, scipy

1. set mean(average), std_dev, min_value and max_val from SEAMCAT -> Event Results -> Select one connection(either victim to interferer or victim to victim) ->SINR Achived (shoulb be in arrays)
2. set num_samples as number of simulation events selected for simulation
3. Set number of beans  for PDF (between 35-50 for thesis)
4. Set CDF/PDF range
